# Depth + RGB Videos of Criollo Cattle for Body Condition Scoring
---

This dataset contains a collection of preclassified Criollo cow RGB+depth videos, as well as processed depth, grayscale, and edge (DGE) images. 
The dataset was previously used to train convolutional neural networks and vision transformers to estimate body condition scores of cattle, 
and will be useful to other researchers in need of a high quaility visual dataset that incorporates depth for the purposes of three dimensional representations of cattle. 
The availability of compatible software and image processing packages makes this dataset very robust and applicable to other areas of both agricultural and machine learning research. 
This dataset has several features that make it a good test of machine learning algorithms such as low sample uniqueness and a slightly subjective metric

This dataset was generated by capturing video of Criollo cattle from the Jornada Experimental Range from October 2021 to March 2022.
The raw videos were then labeled according to the mode of the judges' scores, and then processed according to the procedure described in <insert paper here>.
Code related to this process, as well as the code necessary to make custom datasets and train vision transformers can be found here:

## Description of the data and file structure
  
  The raw RGB+Depth videos are stored in the form of rosbag files. These are easily manipulated through the use of the Intel RealSense software python package, pyrealsense2.
  They are sorted according to their label with the file architecture Dataset_split\class\cow_'sequence_number'_'eartag_number'.
  Processed data is stored in a similar way Dataset_split\class\image_##. Note that the identifying information for the cow is discarded when the rosbag is 
  converted to images. The labels come from the folder the images are under, not the image name itself. Furthermore, cows that were recorded more than once on the same day are labeled as
  "cow_'sequence_number'_'take_number'". All of these duplicate videos have a single digit for the 'take_number'.
  
  The raw rosbag videos have a resolution of 640x480, with several having 848x480. This difference in resolution is rectified in the
  rosbag extraction software. All image preprocessing, including image resizing to 224x224, is done at extraction time, with all parameters being adjustable according to user input.
  The resulting images are sorted and placed into a file structure suitable for training automatically, and should not require any further input.
  Default values used in the creation of the DGE dataset are included in the rosbag extraction code.
  
  It is recommended that the bags themselves are swapped between dataset splits, rather than series of images, as swapping images could result in non-unique images
  appearing in multiple datasets. This phenomenon is described in detail in <paper>.
